# Computer Graphics assignments

This repository contains all projects made during computer graphics course at UFSM.
The main goal of the projects were to learn computer graphics. Thus, we used a very limited API with the objective of being forced to understand the math and implement it without calling some magic function that does it to us.
The API "Canvas2d" provides us functions that draw points and lines in the screen, and some callbacks (like mouse and render) so we can create applications inside it. The API has some other functions like drawing circles and squares, but we are only allowed to use them after implementing circles and squares manually using points and lines.
All of the projects here were done with such basic API, even the 3d car engine.

I want to present you the gifs of each project:
