Controls:
d = increases the d value of the projection
y = rotates around y-axis
x = rotates around x-axis
p = enables/disables perspective
f = pause/unpause

The goal of this project is demonstrating that I am able to create a 3D car engine using a 2d engine. 
The project uses a very limited API to draw in the screen, providing only drawing of points, lines and some very basic geometric forms. Thus, all the projection and math are done manually by me.
